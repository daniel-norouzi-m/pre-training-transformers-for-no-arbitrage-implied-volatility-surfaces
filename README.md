# Transformer Model for Implied Volatility Surface Modelling

## Introduction

This project aims to create a transformer-based model for modeling implied volatility surfaces, uniquely incorporating key market features such as VIX, S&P returns, and asset returns., and ensuring adherence to no-arbitrage constraints. The model uses advanced techniques such as Conditional Layer Normalization (CLN), parametric continuous convolutional networks (PCCN), and a Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function. The project also employs transfer learning to enhance model performance and adaptability. Pre-trained on high-liquidity options, this model exemplifies the power of transfer learning in financial modeling, allowing seamless fine-tuning for specific, less liquid options to deliver precise and reliable predictions.

#### Surface Preprocessing

1. **Dataset Creation**:
   - **Purpose**: Construct a dataset from raw options data that includes varying market conditions and data completeness.
   - **Method**: Features such as log moneyness, time to maturity, and implied volatility are used along with market features. Data points are clustered and selectively masked to simulate incomplete data scenarios, training the model to predict missing information.
   - **Proportional Sampling**: Implements variable masking proportions to simulate different levels of data availability, enhancing the model's robustness and ability to generalize.

2. **Custom Batch Normalization**:
   - **Purpose**: Normalize features across the dataset to stabilize neural network training.
   - **Method**: Custom batch normalization layers are used to standardize `Input Surface` and `Query Point` features, while separate normalization layers adjust `Market Features`.
   - **Data Integrity**: Ensures non-numeric data like `Datetime` and `Symbol` are preserved unchanged, maintaining essential information for modeling.

- **Method**: Pre-train the model on high-liquidity options, then freeze and add new components to fine-tune with new data.

### Surface Preprocessing

#### Dataset Creation

The dataset is systematically constructed from raw options trading data, which captures key variables such as log moneyness, time to maturity, implied volatility, and relevant market features.

##### Clustering and Masking

To simulate real-world scenarios where all data points might not be available:

1. **Clustering**:
   - Surfaces are divided based on unique datetime and symbol combinations, followed by clustering the points within each surface. This helps to segment the data into meaningful groups, reflecting potential market segmentations.
   - Mathematical formulation:
     ```math
     \text{labels} = \text{KMeans}(n_{\text{clusters}}, \text{random\_state}).\text{fit\_predict}(\text{data points})
     ```

2. **Masking**:
   - Within each cluster, a random subset of points is masked, simulating missing data. This prepares the model to infer missing information effectively.
   - Proportional masking varies to challenge the model under different scenarios:
     ```math
     \text{masked indices} = \text{random choice}(\text{cluster indices}, \text{mask proportion})
     ```

##### Proportional Sampling

Adjusting the proportion of masked data across training instances allows the model to adapt to various levels of data availability, enhancing its robustness and predictive capabilities.

#### Custom Batch Normalization

To ensure that the model inputs are normalized and stable for training:

1. **Feature Normalization**:
   - Each feature, including log moneyness, time to maturity, and implied volatility, is normalized across the batch to ensure zero mean and unit variance, essential for effective model training.
   - Batch normalization is applied separately to the concatenated features of `Input Surface` and `Query Point`:
     ```math
     \text{norm\_feature} = \text{BatchNorm}(\text{concatenated feature})
     ```

2. **Market Features Normalization**:
   - Market features such as return, volatility, and treasury rates are also normalized using batch normalization, catering to their dynamic ranges and distributions:
     ```math
     \text{norm\_market\_feature} = \text{BatchNorm1d}(\text{market feature})
     ```

3. **Preservation of Data Integrity**:
   - Non-numeric data such as `Datetime` and `Symbol` remain unchanged to preserve essential indexing and categorical information, ensuring the contextual relevance of the modelâ€™s output.

This preprocessing step ensures the dataset is not only tailored for effective learning but also mirrors the practical challenges and conditions of financial markets, preparing the model for real-world deployment.

### Input Embedding Section

#### Surface Embedding Block 

##### Inputs
1. **Grid Points $\mathbf{x}_j = (M_j, T_j)$**: Reference points where the encoded values are to be computed, representing moneyness (M) and time to maturity (T).

##### Processing
1. **Parametric Continuous Convolution**:
   - Compute the encoded surface values $h_j$ using PCCN:

```math
h_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} g(\mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{x}_j; \theta) \cdot f_i
```
   
   Where $g$ is parameterized by an MLP, $\mathbf{y}_i$ are the input data points, and $f_i$ are the corresponding IV values.

2. **1x1 Convolution**:
   - Project the 1-channel encoded surface to a higher dimensional space using a 1x1 convolution:
```math
H = \text{Conv1x1}(h, \mathbf{W}_{1x1}, b)
```

3. **2D Positional Encoding**:
   - Add positional encoding to the output of the 1x1 convolution. The positional encoding for each dimension M and T is defined as follows for a dimension size $d_{\text{embedding}}$:

```math
PE(M_j, T_j, 2i) = \sin\left(\frac{M_j}{10000^{4i/d_{\text{embedding}}}}\right)
```
```math
PE(M_j, T_j, 2i+1) = \cos\left(\frac{M_j}{10000^{4i/d_{\text{embedding}}}}\right)
```
```math
PE(M_j, T_j, 2j+\frac{d_{\text{embedding}}}{2}) = \sin\left(\frac{T_j}{10000^{4j/d_{\text{embedding}}}}\right)
```
```math
PE(M_j, T_j, 2j+1+\frac{d_{\text{embedding}}}{2}) = \cos\left(\frac{T_j}{10000^{4j/d_{\text{embedding}}}}\right)
```
   Where $i, j$ are integers in the range $[0, d_{\text{embedding}}/4)$.

   - The full positional encoding $\mathbf{PE}(M_j, T_j)$ is concatenated or added to the embedding vector $H$ from the 1x1 convolution for each grid point:
```math
H_{\text{final}} = H + \mathbf{PE}(M_j, T_j)
```

4. **Layer Normalization**:
   - Apply layer normalization to the final embedding vector to ensure it is properly normalized for input into the subsequent transformer layers:
```math
H_{\text{norm}} = \text{LayerNorm}(H_{\text{final}})
```

##### Output
- **Encoded and Normalized Surface Embeddings $H_{\text{norm}}$**: These embeddings are now ready to be fed into the encoder blocks of the transformer.

#### Pre Encoder Blocks
Refines the grid embeddings with dynamically generated convolutional filters and Conditional Layer Normalization (CLN).

**Mathematical Formulation**:

First, apply the convolutional layer conditioned on market features:

```math
\mathbf{X}_{\text{conv}} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{W}_{\text{conv}}(z) * \mathbf{X}_{\text{grid}} + b)
```

Where $\mathbf{W}_{\text{conv}}(z)$ represents the convolutional filters conditioned on market features.

Then, apply Conditional Layer Normalization (CLN) based on the market features:

```math
\mathbf{Y} = \text{CLN}(\mathbf{X}_{\text{conv}}, z)
```

The CLN operation can be detailed as:

```math
\text{CLN}(\mathbf{X}_{\text{conv}}, z) = \gamma(z) \left(\frac{\mathbf{X}_{\text{conv}} - \mu}{\sigma}\right) + \beta(z)
```

Where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of $\mathbf{X}_{\text{conv}}$, and $\gamma(z)$ and $\beta(z)$ are scale and shift parameters conditioned on market features, computed as:

```math
\gamma(z) = W_\gamma z + b_\gamma
```
```math
\beta(z) = W_\beta z + b_\beta
```

### Surface Encoding

```
```math
\mathbf{V}' = W_v \mathbf{Z} + b_v
```
```math
\text{Attention}(Q', K', V') = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q' K'^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + g(\mathbf{E}_z)\right) V'
```

**Layer Normalization**:
```math
\mathbf{X}' = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{X} + \text{SelfAttention}(Q, K, V, \mathbf{E}_z))
```
```math
\mathbf{Y} = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{X}' + \text{FFN}(\mathbf{X}'), \mathbf{E}_z)
```

### Query Embedding Section

```

#### Pre Decoder Blocks
Prepares the query point embeddings for the decoder by enhancing them with market features.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```math
\mathbf{Q}_{\text{processed}} = \text{CLN}(\text{ReLU}(\text{FC}(\mathbf{Q}_{\text{embed}})), \mathbf{E}_z)
```

### Surface Decoding

#### Decoder Blocks
Generates the output by attending to the encoded surface data and conditioned query points using cross-attention and Conditional Layer Normalization.

**Cross-Attention Mechanism**:
```math
\mathbf{Q}' = \mathbf{Q}_{\text{processed}}
```
```math
\mathbf{K}' = W_k \mathbf{X}_{\text{encoded}} + b_k
```
```math
\mathbf{V}' = W_v \mathbf{X}_{\text{encoded}} + b_v
```
```math
\text{Attention}(Q', K', V') = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q' K'^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + g(\mathbf{E}_z)\right) V'
```

**Layer Normalization**:
```math
\mathbf{Y}' = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{Y} + \text{CrossAttention}(Q, K, V, \mathbf{E}_z))
```
```math
\mathbf{Y}_{\text{final}} = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{Y}' + \text{FFN}(\mathbf{Y}'), \mathbf{E}_z)
```

#### Output Mapping
Maps the decoder output to the target implied volatility value using a fully connected layer.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```math
\text{IV}_{\text{pred}} = \text{FC}(\mathbf{Y}_{\text{final}})
```
